This is my final project for Computer Security

The subject is the security of javascript apps on the web

For my supporting content I wrote a short javascript code 
that detects XSS and demonstrates how escaping content protects
against XSS attacks.

myapp contains an improved app.

  It uses Backbone.js for the client side interaction
          Node.js for the server side
          and mongodb to persist the posts

  It allows the user to post to the website with the option
  of escaping the content.
